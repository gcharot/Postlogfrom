postlogfrom - List all mails sent from a particular address

postlogfrom is a python program that print all mails sent from a particular sender address.

Postfix logs are, by default, splited by events which means is it quite difficult to find mails sent from a particular adress. Below some postfix logs for a mail sent from address sender@domain.tld to recipient@domain.tld will look like

==> SMTP client connection
Apr 11 14:48:47 mailserver postfix/smtpd[18935]: 94F3B60053: client=client.domain.tld[x.x.x.x]
==> sender@domain.tld wants to send an email
Apr 11 14:48:47 mailserver postfix/qmgr[11877]: 94F3B60053: from=<sender@domain.tld>, size=214625, nrcpt=3 (queue active)
 ___ Additional logs : DKIM / Rewrite / ETC ___
==> sender@domain.tld has sent an email to recipient@domain.tld
Apr 11 14:48:48 mailserver postfix/smtp[27121]: 94F3B60053: to=<recipient@domain.tld>, relay=relay.domain.tld[x.x.x.x]:25, delay=2, delays=0.24/0/0.22/1.6, dsn=2.0.0, status=sent (250 server message OK)
==> Mail removed from queue
Apr 11 15:48:48 mailserver postfix/qmgr[11877]: 94F3B60053: removed

The only common variable is the postfix QID

If you want to know which mails have been sent by sender@domain.tld, you will need to get all QIDs matching sender@domain.tld then for each QID find the corresponding "to=" line.

postlogfrom does this boring job for you.
